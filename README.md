### Previous version: [Artificial Intelligence Arts, Fall 2019](https://github.com/aaaven/aiarts2019).

#### Major updates in Spring 2020: Mix runwayML (+ processing) and Keras (+ plaidML backend)
1. use [runwayML](https://runwayml.com/) (through the 14 weeks learning)
2. use [Processing(Java)](https://processing.org/) to communicate with runwayML (for productive purpose)
3. use Processing(Java) to code simple neural networks (week 03, 04)
4. use [Keras](https://keras.io/), and [plaidML](https://github.com/plaidml/plaidml) backend (to use AMD GPU support on macOSX) to open the black box of neural networks (week 04 - week 08)
5. use [Jupyter notebook(https://jupyter.org/)] as IDE
6. consider [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) for training (TBA)
